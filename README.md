## About

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Python application that allows users to interactively visualize and understand how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that lets users select a sorting algorithm, set the speed of visualization, and watch the sorting process in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Adjustable sorting speed and array size for customization.
- Shuffle the array to see different input scenarios.
- Interactive user interface with real-time visual feedback.
- Educational tool for learning sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- numpy library (install using `pip install numpy`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the main Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the graphical user interface to select a sorting algorithm, adjust the sorting speed and array size, and start the visualization.

3. Watch the sorting algorithm in action on the Canvas display. Enjoy learning and experimenting with sorting algorithms!
